## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Follow the Python naming conventions (e.g., lowercase with underscores for variables and functions, CamelCase for classes).
- Avoid using single-letter variable names, except for simple loop counters.

## Code Organization

- Organize your code into logical modules and packages.
- Use meaningful directory and file names.
- Separate concerns by dividing your code into smaller functions and classes.
- Follow the PEP 8 style guide for code formatting.

## Error Handling

- Handle exceptions gracefully and provide informative error messages.
- Use try-except blocks to catch and handle specific exceptions.
- Avoid using bare except clauses; be specific about the exceptions you catch.

## Logging

- Use logging to record important events and debug information.
- Include relevant information in log messages, such as timestamps and log levels.
- Configure logging to write logs to a file or other appropriate destinations.

## Documentation

- Document your code using docstrings for functions, classes, and modules.
- Provide clear explanations of the purpose, inputs, and outputs of your code.
- Use comments sparingly and only when necessary to clarify complex code.

## Security

- Follow security best practices when handling user data.
- Avoid storing sensitive information in plain text.
- Use encryption and secure protocols when communicating with external services.
- Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
